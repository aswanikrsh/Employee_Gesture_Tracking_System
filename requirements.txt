# NOTE:
# - This file is intentionally minimal. Installing `ultralytics` and `insightface`
#   will pull additional dependencies automatically. If you need a full, pinned
#   environment (including exact versions for all transitive deps), let me know
#   and I can produce a more exhaustive `requirements.txt` or a `conda` env.
